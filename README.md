Packet Sniffer

This packet sniffer was created for the Lab 04 of the CS-0116, Cybersecurity. Using Scapy, the system is built to scan either a .pcap file or wireless physical interface for XMAS, FIN, NULL, and Nikto scans. 
It also should identify users scanning for systems running RDP and plaintext password sent over the wire using the FTP, HTTP, or IMAP protocols.
